        Dear Hacktoberfest participants. Please note that in order for
        your contributions to be reasonably useful to the community,
        you should take a great care about the quality of your pull
        requests. Failing to do so creates a lot of harm hurting
        many wonderful project maintainers. Here's a bit more context
        explaining the problem:

        by funding the FOSS efforts instead of disturbing them:

### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [ansible/pylibssh](https://github.com/ansible/pylibssh),
  [ansible/ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) by day 🌅 and when the sun goes
  down 🌇 I do [all sorts of other FOSS things](https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz).
  I used to be heavily involved with [ansible/ansible-lint](
  /ansible/ansible-lint) but now I've left it in the hands of [@ssbarnea](
  https://github.com/sponsors/ssbarnea) — please support him in leading the project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [CPython Internals](
https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/)
  and [the basics of OpenShift](
  https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/do180-introduction-containers-kubernetes-red-hat-openshift)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on improving the Python ecosystem around
  making GitHub Apps and Actions, packaging, testing, CI/CD
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting more hours in a day
- 💬 Ask me about Python packaging, CI/CD, pytest, creating GitHub Apps,
  GitHub Actions, Ansible Collections, CherryPy internals,
  async in Python 3, tox, Gentoo Linux, Git, code reviews, linters,
  maintaining the compatibility with legacy Pythons, dev env, burnouts
- 📫 How to reach me: tweet
- 😄 Pronouns: [he/him](http://pronoun.is/he)
- ⚡ Fun fact: wanting to "fix" a game got me interested in computers
  when I was 7 but when I got older I lost interest in games, worked in
  gaming for just 3 months and never looked back
